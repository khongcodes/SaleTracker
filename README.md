# SaleTracker

Welcome to SaleTracker, a basic point-of-sale Sinatra app.

Designed with a framework suitable for selling print material at Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo (MICE).

Features:
1. User registration and log-in
2. Basic data validation in forms
3. User-specific object editing
4. A link to MICE's map and list of exhibitors

Qualifying factors:
- I was going to scrape MICE's map and exhibitor list but I was short on time, and I realized - why bother essentially recreating a webpage as it already exists?
- Sell and Stats pages still need to be finished.

I'll seek to address these in future version updates.
